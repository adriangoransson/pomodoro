# Pomodoro time tracker

Simple timer built according to the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) which has been of tremendous help for me to get studying.

I made it because I couldn't find one already that worked well on both mobile and desktop.

## Features

* Responsive, works well on both mobile and desktop devices
* Customizable and using localStorage to save your preferences
* Progressive Web App, accessible offline
* Ticking sound during focus rounds
* Notification when round is over
* Light and dark themes
* Keyboard shortcut (space) to pause/resume
* Fast and "lightweight". Around 30kb gzipped (not including audio or image assets)
